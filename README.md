# KaizenClient - An online restaurant take-out ordering app

Kaizen is designed to help small restaurants with limited budgets add online ordering to customers.  This repo contains the front-end app that will be used in conjunction with the backed-end API.

## Development Status: On Hold

Development on this client began as part of my GA capstone and the Ember framework's potential was an attractive addition to the project.  However, I experienced some struggles getting through Ember's learning curve early on and given the capstone's tight timeline I decided not shelve it for the initial MVP.  Future versions of this app will likely incorporate Ember or similar framework if requirements so dictate.

## App components

- Ember.js
- JavaScript
